        In the editor, use the `os` library to print the name of
        the current folder.
      filesystem: fs1.yaml
      editor:
          - {name: showfolder.py, contents: ""}

    - question_format: md
      question: >
        # The `os` library

        Now run your program in the terminal.
      answer: # This is the answer for this q, and setup for next q

        Good work. _Add_ another line to your program to print a list
        of all the files inside the current folder. The `os` library
        provides a perfect function for this.

                - {name: showfolder.py, contents: showfolder2.py}

        # Change folder

        Now run your modified program.
      answer: # This is the answer for this q, and setup for next q
