        In the text editor, Make a list called `items1`

        # Join lists

        In a new line, create another list called `items2`
        with two values `3` and `4`.
      answer: # This is the answer for this q, and setup for next q

        # Join lists

        In another new line, create another list called
        `items_all`, by joining the other two lists
        together.
      answer: # This is the answer for this q, and setup for next q
            editor:

        # Join lists

        Great! Now add one last line to display the
        contents of `items_all`.
      answer: # This is the answer for this q, and setup for next q
            editor:
                - {name: fixup.py, contents: fixup4.py}
