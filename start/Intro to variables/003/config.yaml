        In the editor, store the text `hot` in a variable
        called `x`.
      filesystem: fs1.yaml

          - {name: setvar.py, contents: ""}

      question: >
        # Set a var

        Add a line that stores the text `water` in a new variable
        called `y`.

        # Set a var

        Add one more line that will display the value of both `x`
        and `y` together. We also want a blank space between the
        two words.

        Now run your program in the terminal. See how variables
        make it easy to work with data?
